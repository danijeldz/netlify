# Installing HUGO on ElementaryOS
---
Considering the fact that ElementaryOS is based on UBUNTU, the recomended procedure for istalling HUGO would be to use apt-get tool for installation.  
But this was we will not get the latest version of Hugo installment packages. Better was is to do the following:  
1. Go to Hugo's github releases [repository](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases)
2. Download appropriate install package, in my case hugo_0.31.1.Linux-64bit.deb 
3. Install package with GDebi package installer  
That's it! You are ready to start generate your own static pages with Hugo.
